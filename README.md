DMs, GMs, and players alike are welcome to generate quick names for a last-minute session

This is my first solo attempt to learn Python, so I decided to help out those dms whose parties hyperfocus on a character that didn't have a name until they asked.

This is my second day of Python and the basic working portion of this code was written from the hours of 00:00 to 01:30. I plan on making this look more pretty, but it should be totally usable in the meantime. I do have to actually learn now to do that first.

I'm also learning how GitHub works so expect some newbie weirdness.

(PS. Get it? Dummies? DM-ies? I'll let myself out)
